## About Me

Kai Zhang is a research data engineer at Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (SRIBD). He is affiliated to the Government and Industrial Big Data Lab where he primarily works on delivering insight and impact for government and enterprises through a wide range of flexible support models, providing ad hoc, deeply transformational, and ongoing analytics architecture and solutions. Before joining SRIBD, Kai received his Master's degree in Biostatistics from Cornell University, and a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

## Research Interests

- **Statistical Learning:** time series, quantitative finance, interpretable machine learning
- **Causal Inference:** econometrics, targeted learning, experimental design and analysis

## Projects

- **Cell Type Identification of Mouse Retinal Pigment Epithelium from ScRNA-seq Data (Supervised by Prof. Xi Kathy Zhou at Cornell University)**
  <br>
  This project used unsupervised learning methods to identify the cellular composition and activities of mouse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from
  single-cell transcriptomics, and further to detect cell-to-cell variation by statistical methods. We firstly processed raw sequence data into a high-quality expression data
  following _Scater_ workflow, including rigorous pre-processing, quality control, feature selection and PCA dimensionality reduction. Then, multiple clustering algorithms were
  performed and compared on cells to identify RPE cell types, including K-means, DBSCAN and SNN graph-based clustering. Finally, potential gene markers were detected for each
  cell class using pairwise t-test with BH adjustment for multiple comparisons.
